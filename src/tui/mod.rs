//! ratatui dashboard (FR6): per-account quota gauges (5h/7d) with reset
//! countdowns, active/cooldown status, activity log, totals.
//!
//! IA (issue #5): a wall-clock MAIN view that is ALWAYS rendered (header ·
//! account quota table · scheduler/totals summary · compact model strip ·
//! in-flight/activity) plus three summoned [`Overlay`]s drawn OVER it —
//! `a`ccounts (account detail + add/remove/login affordances), `g` stats (the
//! detailed per-model table + drill-down), `l`ogs (full-screen tail). `Esc`
//! closes any overlay back to MAIN. MAIN-level keys: `q`uit, `R`eload config,
//! `f`/`m`/`e` codex, `↑↓` scroll. The account interactions (`s`witch, `a`dd,
//! `r`emove, `n`ew browser login) run within the Accounts overlay as [`Mode`]s.
//!
//! Two entry points, ONE renderer:
//! - [`run_local`] — in-process mode (`llmux server` on a TTY): renders
//!   live `AppState` (pool + dashboard hub) directly.
//! - [`run_remote`] — attach mode (`llmux dashboard`, or `llmux
//!   server` when a daemon already owns the port): polls
//!   `GET /llmux/dashboard` every second and renders the fetched
//!   document. Manual switch goes through `POST /llmux/switch`; account
//!   add/remove (issue #3) go through `POST /llmux/add-account` /
//!   `POST /llmux/remove-account`, so they work in attach mode too. Only `R`
//!   (reload from the local config file) stays local-mode-only.
//!
//! Both paths build the same [`view::DashboardView`] (local: from an
//! in-process [`crate::dashboard::DashboardDoc`]; remote: from the fetched
//! JSON) — the draw code in [`ui`] is never forked.
