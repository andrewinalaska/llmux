//! Model catalog served by `GET /models` and `GET /llmux/models`.
//!
//! Descriptive metadata — the ids, human names, reasoning-effort menus, and
//! context windows of the KNOWN models: a curated set plus the live grok pin.
//! This is NOT an exhaustive list of everything routable: at request time the
//! grok provider passes ANY `grok-*` id through verbatim, so a config that
//! pins an id outside the curated set still works — it simply appears here as
//! a synthesized row with null metadata (see [`catalog`]). This module carries
//! no request-shaping/acceptance logic (that lives per provider). One dynamic
//! bit: the grok family alias `"grok"` attaches to whichever grok id is the
//! live pin, mirroring [`crate::provider::grok`]'s bare-`grok` routing.
//!
//! Sources (evidence gathered 2026-07-14; claude rows re-curated 2026-07-27;
//! fable alias rolled to 5.1 on 2026-09-02; claude rows re-curated 2026-09-23
//! to add the `claude-opus-5-5` pair and roll the floating `opus` alias off
//! `claude-opus-5[1m]` onto `claude-opus-5-5[1m]`; grok rows re-probed
//! 2026-09-23 for the `grok-4.7` row and the default-pin roll 4.6 → 4.7):
//! - Claude rows: user-curated 2026-07-27, and they live in [`CLAUDE_MODELS`]
//!   — that const is the SSOT for both these rows and the alias→id resolution
//!   in [`crate::provider::anthropic`] (Claude Code model picker; `[1m]`
//!   suffix marks the 1M-context variant ids). The effort menus are the Claude
//!   Code `/effort` levels, applied per the user contract — llmux itself does
//!   NOT shape claude request PARAMETERS (effort/thinking are client metadata,
//!   advertised here and passed through). It DOES normalize the outbound
//!   `model` field: [`crate::provider::anthropic`] resolves a curated alias to
//!   its catalog id and strips the `[1m]` context suffix, with
//!   [`CLAUDE_MODELS`] as the mapping source.
//! - Codex context windows and effort menus: the openai/codex model catalog
//!   (`models-manager/models.json`), fetched 2026-07-14 and re-fetched
//!   2026-09-07 for generation 6, and again 2026-09-28 (which added
//!   `gpt-6-sol` / `gpt-6-luna`). `gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-6-sol` and
//!   `gpt-5.6-sol/terra` support low..ultra; `gpt-6-luna` and `gpt-5.6-luna`
//!   low..max; `gpt-5.5` low..xhigh. `gpt-6-astra` owns the bare generation
//!   aliases; all gpt-6 rows have catalog context 272,000. The `[1m]` rows are
//!   the codex side of the `[1m]` opt-in and carry OpenAI's published ~1,050,000-token window rather than the
//!   catalog figure; live probes 2026-08-21 against the ChatGPT-account
//!   backend corroborate it on SOL specifically (910,229 accepted, ~936k
//!   rejected) and reach only 555,029 accepted on terra — astra's `[1m]` row
//!   rides OpenAI's published figure and has NOT been probed through the
//!   daemon.
//! - Grok context windows / names: the live `cli-chat-proxy` `/v1/models`
//!   probe — `grok-4.5` ctx 500000 (2026-07-14), `grok-4.6` ctx 500000, name
//!   "Grok 4.6" (2026-08-13), `grok-4.7` ctx 500000, name "Grok 4.7"
//!   (2026-09-23; the same response also lists `grok-4.7-build-fast`, which is
//!   NOT curated). Grok effort menus come from
//!   [`crate::provider::grok::thinking_levels_catalog`] (models with no
//!   thinking support get an empty menu). The curated grok set is `grok-4.7`
//!   (plus its opt-in `grok-4.7[1m]` picker twin), `grok-4.6` and `grok-4.5`;
//!   any other `grok-*` id passes through at request time and synthesizes a
//!   null-metadata row when pinned.

    // on the FULL id, with no preference for a `[1m]` twin — deliberately
    // unlike the astra rule above. Pinning `grok-4.7` therefore leaves the

    // way it normalizes a requested id (`strip_client_context_suffix` in
    // `crate::provider::grok`), so either pin reaches xAI as `grok-4.7`.
    // Why no twin preference: not because of the client's window (a bare
    // `grok` from Claude Code is a 200k session whoever owns the alias — the
    // client sizes off the submitted id), but because ownership decides what
    // llmux ADVERTISES as the family default. Preferring the twin would make
    // the 1M-denominated id the face of the family in `/llmux/models` and the
    // picker, and Claude Code reads that id as an 800k usable budget while
