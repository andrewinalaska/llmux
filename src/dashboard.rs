//! Dashboard state + document: the single source of truth behind both the
//! in-process TUI and the remote attach mode (`llmux dashboard`).
//!
//! - [`DashboardHub`] — server-owned fold of the activity-event stream and
//!   the tracing bridge: activity ring, per-account totals, last switch,
//!   poller health, log console. Lives in `proxy::server::AppState`; one
//!   fold task ([`fold`]) consumes the event/log channels into it.
//! - [`DashboardDoc`] — the serializable superset of `/llmux/status`
//!   served at `GET /llmux/dashboard`. The local TUI builds the SAME
//!   document in-process every frame and the remote client parses it from JSON,
//!   so both render paths share one contract (`tui::view` converts it into
//!   the view-model the draw code consumes).
