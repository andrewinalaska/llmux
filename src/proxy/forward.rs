//! Request rewrite + upstream call + the error taxonomy
//! (`.prd/02-architecture.md` §Error taxonomy): 429 park/retry, 401
//! refresh-once, transient vs persistent failures.
//!
//! Deviations from the Node reference (`teamclaude src/server.js`), forced by
//! axum/reqwest reality — documented per the task contract:
//!
//! - **Transient errors** (connect refused/reset/timeout, upstream 5xx per
//!   the architecture table): Node destroys the client socket so the client
//!   retries. An axum handler cannot destroy the TCP socket; the closest
//!   faithful behavior is `502` + `Connection: close` — hyper closes the
//!   connection after the response and Claude Code's retry logic fires on
//!   the 5xx. (Node relays upstream 5xx bodies; the architecture table
//!   classifies 5xx as transient — the table wins here.)
//! - **429 handling** is split, unlike Node's wait-always: `retry-after ≤ 5s`
//!   waits and retries the SAME account (bounded); longer parks the account
//!   via `record_429` and retries on the next eligible account (Node has no
//!   scheduler to switch to; we do).
//! - `forward` owns lease acquisition (the retry loop needs to re-lease
//!   after a switch), so it takes the whole request instead of a pre-made
//!   lease.
