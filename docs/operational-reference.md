# llmux operational reference

This is the detailed, operational half of the docs: every command, the daemon/dashboard model, the configuration reference, the scheduling policy, model routing details, and the Codex backend. The conceptual overview — what llmux is and why — lives in [the root README](../README.md).

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `server [--port N] [--no-tui] [--log-to DIR]` | Start the proxy. `--log-to` writes one file per request with credentials masked. If a llmux daemon already owns the port, attach to it instead. |
| `run [--force] [-- args]` | Ensure the daemon is running, then spawn `claude` pointed at the proxy. `--force` restarts the daemon even if a same-version one is already up. |
| `stop` | Stop a running server gracefully via `POST /llmux/shutdown`. |
| `restart` | Cooperatively drain a running daemon, then respawn it from this binary after an upgrade. |
| `login [--api \| --codex \| --grok \| --openrouter [--paste]]` | Add a Claude account via browser OAuth; `--api` pastes an Anthropic API key; `--codex` runs the ChatGPT OAuth flow, falling back to importing `~/.codex/auth.json`, to add a Codex account; `--grok` runs the xAI device-code flow; `--openrouter` runs the OpenRouter OAuth PKCE flow in the browser and mints a long-lived `sk-or-v1-…` key. `--paste` (only with `--openrouter`) prompts for an existing key instead of opening a browser — and is also the automatic fallback when the browser flow cannot complete locally. |
| `import [--from PATH \| --json JSON]` | Import credentials from a teamclaude config, `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, a Codex `~/.codex/auth.json`, or inline JSON. |
| `dashboard` | Attach to a running daemon and render its dashboard over HTTP. Read-only except manual account switch. |
| `env` | Print shell exports for pointing Claude Code at the proxy. |
| `status [--json]` | Show client/server/update sections plus per-account quota; exits 1 when no server is running. |
| `accounts [-v]` | List configured accounts; `-v` adds quota/cooldown detail. |
| `accounts refresh [ACCOUNT]` | Re-read usage from the provider NOW, on the target daemon, for one account or every supported subscription account. Per-account failures stay visible and the command exits nonzero if any requested account failed. |
| `accounts resets ACCOUNT` | List the account's upstream rate-limit reset entitlements. Read-only — it can never redeem. |
| `accounts reset ACCOUNT [--credit-id ID] [--request-id ID] [--yes]` | Redeem exactly ONE rate-limit reset. A TTY confirmation names the account and the reset; a non-TTY requires `--yes`. The request id is minted by the client, printed before the send, and must be REUSED (`--request-id`) to retry an uncertain attempt. |
| `remove <name> [--yes]` | Remove an account by name. |
| `key new --name L [--email E] [--admin]` | Issue a downstream client key (multi-tenant). The secret is printed once and never stored. |
| `key list` | List issued client keys (id, name, email, kind, state, prefix). |
| `key suspend\|resume\|remove\|rotate <id\|name>` | Suspend/resume/revoke/rotate a key. Takes effect on the very next request — no restart. `remove` is a soft-revoke: usage history keeps its name/email. `rotate` issues a new secret under the same attribution id. |
| `api <path>` | Debug: GET an upstream path with the current account's credentials. |

In the TUI: `s` switches account, `a` adds, `n` starts a new browser login, `r` removes, `R` reloads config, `d` toggles detail, `l` cycles the log panel, `p` opens the perf tab, `K` opens the keys tab (multi-tenant client keys + per-tenant usage; read-only — mutations go through `llmux key …`), `q` quits, and `j`/`k` or arrows navigate. For Codex accounts, `f` toggles fast (priority) mode, `m` cycles the model, and `e` cycles reasoning effort. The Grok group's `effort:` value on the same settings bar is click-cycled (or activated from the config tab's `grok.reasoning_effort` row): `bypass → none → low → medium → high → xhigh`, with the per-model clamp still applied at request time — `xhigh` rides through on `grok-4.6` and lands as `high` on `grok-4.5`. In the accounts overlay, `f` refreshes usage and `R` redeems one rate-limit reset (see [Usage controls](#usage-controls-refresh--resets)) — on MAIN those keys keep their old meanings (`f` codex fast, `R` reload config). Accounts rows are grouped Claude → Codex → Grok → OpenRouter, and `o` (MAIN or the accounts overlay) toggles the order WITHIN each group between account name (the default; a natural, numeric-aware order — digit runs compare as numbers, so a block reads `ai`, `ai1`, `ai2`, … `ai10`, not `ai10`, `ai1`, `ai`) and the scheduler's next-pick order — the pane title reports which is active. Left-clicking an accounts row (dashboard or accounts tab) opens a scrollable modal with every detail recorded for that account — Esc closes it, and right-click still opens the row's context menu. In attach mode (`llmux dashboard`, or `server` attaching to a daemon), config-mutation keys `a`/`r`/`R` (reload) are disabled because they would act on the server host's config; `s` still works through `POST /llmux/switch`, and the usage controls work because they act on the daemon. Activity-panel mouse semantics are described under [Activity feed](#activity-feed).

### Usage controls (refresh · resets)

An external Codex reset does not invalidate llmux's observed quota window, so a freshly reset account can keep reading as exhausted. The accounts surface owns the two explicit controls that fix that, and both act on the DAEMON — identically in local and attach mode.

- **Refresh.** `f` in the accounts overlay refreshes every supported account; `f` inside the `s` switcher refreshes the highlighted one; `llmux accounts refresh [ACCOUNT]` does the same from a shell. A refresh performs a real upstream usage read (no inference request is sent), bypasses scheduler eligibility and the idle-probe cooldown, and changes no pause/health/operator state. A failed read keeps the previous observation and reports the error — it never blanks the gauges. Entering the accounts surface requests ONE refresh when the reset inventory is missing or older than 60 s; `f` has no such floor.
- **Reset inventory.** The accounts table gains an `rst` column and the detail pane a `reset` line: `3` resets owned, `3*` owned but upstream currently reports none applicable, `?` not observed yet, `—` a provider with no resets at all. Unknown is never rendered as `0`. `llmux accounts resets ACCOUNT` prints the same inventory with per-credit detail.
- **Redeem one reset.** `R` in the accounts overlay opens a confirmation that names the account and the single reset it spends (`r` still removes an account — the redemption is deliberately the shifted key). `y` redeems; any other key closes the dialog. `llmux accounts reset ACCOUNT` is the shell equivalent and refuses on a non-TTY without `--yes`. A new redemption requires a fresh entitlement read showing a redeemable credit; unknown or zero inventory refuses before any redemption is attempted.
- **Idempotency.** The client mints the redemption's request id, prints it before sending, and holds it until a terminal outcome (`reset`, `already_redeemed`, `nothing_to_reset`, `no_credit`). Closing the TUI dialog does not abandon a pending redemption, and a retry reuses the SAME id — a fresh key could spend a second reset. On an uncertain outcome the CLI prints the exact `--request-id` invocation to repeat. `already_redeemed` means the replay spent nothing extra. If the follow-up usage read fails after a successful redemption, that is a success with a stale-read warning, not a retryable failure.
- **Forced switch.** Selecting an account with `s` (or `POST /llmux/switch`) refreshes that account's usage BEFORE committing, including when it is already the active account — re-selecting is how you force a fresh read. The client no longer pre-judges eligibility from cached windows (a stale 100% could otherwise block the very switch that refreshes it); the pool remains the authority on pause, auth and cooldown, and a failed pre-switch refresh is shown as a separate warning rather than as a failed switch.

`n` (from the accounts overlay or the account switcher) opens a provider picker — Claude (Anthropic OAuth), Codex (ChatGPT OAuth), Grok (xAI device code — it prints the verification URL and user code, best-effort opens the browser, then polls), OpenRouter (PKCE minting an `sk-or-v1-…` key). `↑↓` picks, `Enter` runs the flow, `Esc` cancels. The OAuth flow runs in the client that owns the keyboard, and the minted credential is injected into the daemon — in-process locally, over `POST /llmux/inject-account` when attached — so the account serves traffic without a restart and `n` is live in attach mode too. On a client with no browser (a headless SSH session), `n` refuses with the `llmux login` fallback hint instead of starting a flow that would hang.

**Login identity and re-login.** A Claude OAuth login identifies the account by the `accountUuid` on its profile. If the profile fetch fails, or the profile carries no stable `accountUuid`, the login now **errors and saves nothing** — the freshly minted tokens are discarded with it — instead of storing an unidentified placeholder account that the next login would duplicate rather than update; re-running the login is the remedy. An identified profile with no email is named after its uuid. **Logging in again with an account you already have replaces the credentials in place and keeps the established local account name**, even if the profile email has since changed: operator pause, per-account limits, quota windows, cooldowns, in-flight leases and the sticky current selection are all keyed by that name, so a rename would silently resume a paused account and drop its ceilings. The account name is a stable local label, not a mirror of the current profile email. On a running daemon the re-login takes effect without a restart, and a credential that ACTUALLY changed also clears an authentication-failure bench back to healthy — re-applying byte-identical credentials (a pause toggle, an `import`, a re-inject of the same bytes) never resurrects a failed account. Work that started before the re-login and carries the retired credential — an in-flight request's 401, a dead refresh token, a background refresh or usage poll — is discarded rather than applied, so it can no longer re-bench the account or overwrite the fresh credential in memory or in the config file; a genuine 401 from the CURRENT credential still benches the account. Design detail and the races behind these guards: [re-login trace](keys-history/relogin-trace.md).

### Usage tab (calendar usage + cost)

The `usage` tab (`U`, or click the tab bar) shows calendar-bucketed usage over the persisted request history: hourly, daily, or monthly buckets (`g` cycles), each bucket broken down per model with request count, the four token classes (input / output / cache read / cache write), and the API-equivalent USD cost per model and per bucket. `j`/`k` (or arrows, the mouse wheel, `PgUp`/`PgDn`; `Home`/`End` jump) scroll by bucket; the title carries the period totals. Retention: hourly buckets cover the trailing 72 h, daily buckets 180 days, monthly buckets are unbounded (all replayed history from `activity.jsonl`). Day/month boundaries follow the daemon's local calendar; costs are API-equivalent estimates priced with the daemon's `pricing` overrides — not a bill. Amounts render ledger-style — decimal points aligned to one column (up to $999,999 per bucket), thousands separators, integer digits emphasized over the dimmer fraction digits, per-model rows a tier darker than bucket totals. A model with no known rate shows `—` instead of a cost, its bucket total is marked `+?`, and the title gains `(+unpriced)` — a missing rate is never rendered as a free `$0`. The same rows are served to attach clients on `GET /llmux/dashboard` (`usage_stats`), so local and remote render identically.

### Perf tab (observed performance)

The `perf` tab (`p`, or click the tab bar) is the observed-performance surface: passive telemetry from real proxied requests — deliberately not an active healthcheck. Three panes over a selectable trailing span (`d` cycles 7/14/30/90 days):

- **Daily tokens/sec chart** — one braille line per top `(provider, model, fast)` series, y = end-to-end output tokens/sec (`Σoutput / Σduration` per day).
- **Provider health matrix** — one row per day, one column per provider: request count, error %, average TTFB (time to first upstream body byte), and e2e t/s. A day with no traffic renders `—`, never a fabricated `0`.
- **Series table** — per `(provider, model, fast)` over the span (`j`/`k` scroll): requests, error %, output tokens, `e2e t/s`, `est t/s`, average TTFB, and measured coverage (`measured/throughput` samples).

Metric semantics (v1, deliberately conservative):

- `e2e t/s` = output tokens / total request duration — always available, includes queueing and time-to-first-token.
- TTFB and the first-delta offset are measured from the **served attempt's upstream dispatch** (the moment the winning upstream request was sent) — request-body buffering, scheduling, token refreshes, and 429 parks never contaminate them.
- `est t/s` = output tokens / the **stream-side span from the first streamed output delta to the end of the upstream stream** (fixed inside the relay pump at upstream EOF — file IO and post-processing never inflate it) (the first `content_block_delta`, thinking deltas included; empty deltas never count). Labeled *estimated* because hidden reasoning (e.g. Codex reasoning that streams only as summaries) may precede the first delta — this is **not** a model decode-speed claim. Derived only from requests whose UPSTREAM stream produced a first delta (a client asking for `stream=false` still counts — llmux streams from the provider either way); legacy history and upstream JSON/non-SSE responses never mix into it.
- Codex **fast mode** splits every series: `⚡` = fast on, no marker = off, `?` = history recorded before the field existed (unknown — kept separate, never counted as off).
- Confidence is judged per statistic: `e2e` dims under its own throughput-sample count, `est` under its measured-sample count (fewer than 5 → dim; still shown — low traffic is itself a signal); aggregates whose summed span can't support a stable ratio show `—`. Quiet days are chart GAPS and `—` health rows, never a fabricated `0`. A mid-stream upstream abort — transport break, converter-level `response.failed`, or an SSE `error` event — counts as an error even though the client already held a 200. In the perf tab, `h`/`l` (←/→) drill the series table into a single day (the user-facing per-day provider/model stats); `Esc`-ward `l` past today returns to the span aggregate.
- Data is rebuilt from the persisted request log on restart and retained 90 days; the tab title carries `timing since <date>` — the first day that actually observed v1 timing, not the oldest replayed legacy row.

The activity feed gains the same per-request view: a `t/s` column (e2e) on every completed row, and the click-expanded detail shows `e2e` / `est … post-delta` / `ttfb` / `first output` when recorded. Attach clients receive the same rows on `GET /llmux/dashboard` (`daily_perf`).

In the `sessions` tab, `o` cycles the sort (recent → tokens → requests), the mouse wheel moves the cursor, and a left-click selects the row under the pointer. The `t/s` column is the honest per-session output rate — Σ output tokens over Σ recorded request durations (raw-io records now carry `duration_ms`; pre-field history shows `—`, never a wall-clock-span fake).

### Config tab (the config editor)

The `config` tab (`c`, or click the tab bar) is a mouse-driven config editor covering the **entire** config schema — every field appears with an honest apply-state label:

- `live` — applies immediately (holder-backed; persisted read-merge-write first, then flipped in the running daemon). Covers scheduler mode + ceilings + usage max age, codex model/effort/fast, grok effort, routing on/off, raw-io capture on/off, email mask, quota fill, TUI effects, the Fable weekly gauge.
- `restart` — persisted now, effective on the next daemon start (routing default/on-empty group, raw-io retention and body cap, gradient speed, upstreams, port, max request bytes). The status line always says which — a saved-but-not-yet-live change never reads as applied.
- `session` — this TUI only (reset display).
- `ro` — managed elsewhere, with the note saying where (accounts → Accounts tab, per-account limits → `L`, events → `POST /llmux/events`, pricing/gradient colors/domain abbreviations → config file, `remote.api_key` → secret).

`j`/`k` (or the wheel) move the cursor; **Enter or a left-click on the value cell** activates the row — toggles flip in place, value rows open a prefilled edit prompt (`Enter` applies, `Esc` cancels). Blast-radius changes — scheduler mode, `routing.enabled`, raw-io capture, upstream endpoints, a ceiling set to 0, a retention decrease — ask `y/n` first. Everything goes through `POST /llmux/settings` semantics (identical validation locally and in attach mode); invalid values are rejected before anything is written.

The `misc` tab (`?`) carries the keybinding reference plus daemon facts: config path, account count, raw-io capture state and file size, and the activity-log size (sizes refresh at most every 30s).

## Install and launch details

### Homebrew channels

```bash
brew install 2lab-ai/tap/llmux
brew install 2lab-ai/tap/llmux-islands
brew install 2lab-ai/tap/llmux-preview
```

Use `llmux-preview` for the rolling preview channel. Use the stable `llmux` formula for normal daily work.

### Channels and updating

llmux is distributed through the [Homebrew tap](https://github.com/2lab-ai/homebrew-tap) on two channels: `stable` (formula `llmux`) and `preview` (formula `llmux-preview`). The active channel is derived from what brew has installed — there is no config field.

```bash
# Print the current channel
llmux channel

# Update in place on the current channel (brew upgrade), restarting the
# daemon if the binary changed or the running one is a different build
llmux update

# Switch channels now (brew uninstall old + install new, mirrored onto the
# llmux-islands cask; restarts a running daemon)
llmux channel preview
llmux channel stable
```

`llmux update` also restarts a running daemon whose version differs from the binary brew has installed, so a daemon left behind by an out-of-band `brew upgrade` — or by a restart skipped on an earlier run — converges instead of reporting "already up to date" while serving the old build. The comparison is server-vs-installed-artifact (`<installed llmux> --version`), not against the `llmux` process you invoked, which may itself be a stale keg or the other channel's binary.

### How a preview reaches brew

A preview is published when the tap points at it, not when the prerelease exists. The `Preview` workflow's `publish` job creates `preview-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<sha12>` and then, in the same job, renders `Formula/llmux-preview.rb` + `Casks/llmux-islands-preview.rb` from the exact assets it just uploaded and pushes them to [`2lab-ai/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/2lab-ai/homebrew-tap) ([`.github/scripts/bump-tap-preview.sh`](../.github/scripts/bump-tap-preview.sh)). `brew upgrade llmux-preview` therefore sees a merge to `main` within one workflow run — no waiting.

- **Credential:** repository secret **`TAP_DISPATCH_TOKEN`** (a token with push access to the tap), consumed as `GH_TOKEN` through `gh auth setup-git`, so it lives only in the runner's ephemeral git credential helper and never in a remote URL or the log. This is the only tap credential this repo has; an earlier `TAP_PUSH_KEY` deploy key was referenced by the workflow but never registered, which made every bump silently skip.
- **Fail-closed:** a missing credential, a missing asset, or a failed push fails the `publish` job. Re-run the job — the release upload and the bump are both idempotent (a tap already at this tag is a no-op). The tap's own 6h `bump.yml` cron remains only as a backstop for builds published before this step existed.
- **Never rolls back:** if the tap already points at a *newer* preview minute the bump skips; if it points at a *different* build from the *same minute* the ordering is unknowable from the tag, so the job fails instead of guessing.
- **Regression test:** `.github/scripts/tests/bump-tap-preview.test.sh` (run by the `tap-bump-test` job, which gates `publish`) exercises clone → render → commit → push against a local git remote with a mocked `gh`, and pins every failure mode above to a non-zero exit.

### Source build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2lab-ai/llmux && cd llmux
just build
```

`just build` runs `cargo build --release --locked`.

### Running Claude Code through llmux

`llmux run` spawns `claude` with only `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` set and passes arguments through after `--`. If nothing is listening on the configured port, `run` auto-starts a detached daemon and waits until it is ready.

It also makes Claude Code's `/model` picker list the llmux catalog: `run` fetches `GET /llmux/models` from the proxy it is pointing `claude` at and prepends the lineup as `claude --settings '<modelPicker json>'` (no settings file is written, and the built-in Anthropic rows stay). `--no-model-picker` suppresses the injection, a `--settings` of your own in the pass-through args wins with one warning line, and a failed catalog fetch is a warning that never blocks the launch — see [`models.md`](models.md#claude-code-model-picker).

Daemon stderr is written to `~/.local/state/llmux/server.log`, respecting `$XDG_STATE_HOME`. A port occupied by a foreign process is an error; llmux never overwrites it.

Manual shell wiring:

```bash
eval "$(llmux env)"
claude
```

## Multi-tenant client keys

One llmux server can serve several machines, each with its OWN issued key, so
usage is recorded per tenant (name + email) instead of one anonymous pool.

- Issue on the server: `llmux key new --name z-macbook --email z@2lab.ai`.
  The plaintext (`lmk-…`) is shown once; only its SHA-256 digest is stored.
- On each client PC, point llmux at the server in `~/.config/llmux.json`:
  `{ "remote": { "host": "<server>", "api_key": "lmk-…" } }` — `llmux run`
  then works unchanged and every request is attributed to that key.
- Authorization is two-axis: the key decides the *tenant* (attribution), its
  kind decides the *scope*. `default` keys reach the data plane only
  (`/v1/*`, `/models`); `admin` keys (and the config's own `proxy.api_key`)
  also unlock the `/llmux/*` control plane — key management, account
  mutation, dashboard/status reads. Loopback is NOT a privilege: control
  calls need an admin credential even from localhost (the local CLI presents
  `proxy.api_key` automatically). Keyless requests are loopback-only and are
  metered as the `local` tenant; keyless remote is refused.
- `suspend`/`remove`/`rotate` bite on the next request without a restart
  (the daemon keeps a live key registry; disk and memory update together).
  The last active admin credential can never be suspended or revoked —
  recovery from a lost admin key is editing the config on the server host.
- HTTP surface (admin): `GET /llmux/keys`, `POST /llmux/keys/new`,
  `POST /llmux/keys/suspend` `{id, suspended}`, `POST /llmux/keys/remove`
  `{id}`, `POST /llmux/keys/rotate` `{id}`.
- The dashboard's `keys` tab (`K`) is the admin view: every issued key with
  its name (first column) and a ≤16-cell key cell (`<id>·<prefix>`, never a
  secret), kind, state, requests, ok/err, tokens, API-equivalent cost, the
  used-from → used-to span, and a per-model breakdown — the builtin
  `local`/`legacy` buckets included, so every request is accounted for.
  History persisted before multi-tenant keys shows as the `unknown` tenant —
  it is never folded into a live bucket.

### Keys usage: windows, model filter, durable history

The numbers on the `keys` tab come from a durable per-tenant store, not from
the in-memory activity fold, so they survive restarts and can be narrowed:

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `w` | Cycle the window: `all` → `1h` → `24h` → `7d` → `14d` → `30d` → `90d` → `all`. Each window is the exact closed interval `[now − duration, now]`; future-stamped rows are never counted. |
| `f` | Multi-select the models observed in the current window — `↑/↓` move, `Space` toggles, `a` selects all, `c` clears, `Enter` applies, `Esc` cancels. No selection = every model. The offered list is the window's models, never narrowed by the filter already applied, so a selection can be changed and not just narrowed. |
| `↑/↓`, `PgUp/PgDn`, `Home/End` | Scroll every row, key rows and their model rows alike; `End` stops on the last full page. |
| `r` | Re-run the query. |

On a narrow terminal the table sheds its widest, lowest-value columns (the
`used` span first, then `kind`/`state`/`ok/err`) so the name column and the
`└ group/model` labels stay readable down to 80 columns.

The title always states the active question (`window 24h · 2 model(s) · N
requests`). A pending query says `loading…` and a failed one says why — a
filtered or failed view is never redrawn as unfiltered data or as zeros.
With explicit models selected, requests that failed before routing (no model
attributed) drop out; under `all models` they stay, so the admin view still
accounts for every observed completion.

- **Where it lives.** `~/.config/llmux/usage.sqlite3` for a stable/dev build,
  `~/.config/llmux-preview/usage.sqlite3` for a preview build (the two
  channels never share history). With `$LLMUX_CONFIG` pointing elsewhere the
  store moves to a sibling directory named after that config file
  (`/tmp/x/alt.json` → `/tmp/x/alt/usage.sqlite3`). File `0600`, directory
  `0700`. It holds request METADATA only — when, tenant, group, model,
  status, token counts — never prompts, responses, or credentials.
- **Legacy history.** On startup the daemon imports the existing
  `activity.jsonl` prefix once (transactional byte offset + per-request
  identity), so a restart neither re-imports nor double-counts, and requests
  that land while the import runs are recorded exactly once. The JSONL log is
  NOT deleted or replaced — the activity feed, sessions, perf, and stats
  surfaces keep using it. Rotation is detected by the source's file id AND its
  head bytes, so a replaced or truncated-and-refilled log is re-read instead of
  silently resumed at a stale offset.
- **Migrating a large history.** The import runs in chunks and releases the
  store between them, so a multi-hundred-megabyte `activity.jsonl` never blocks
  live metering or admin queries. While it runs, every answer is partial by
  construction and the panel title says `importing history N%` (the API carries
  `health.importing` / `health.import_pct`). A failed import is counted in
  `health.errors` / `health.last_error`, so an incomplete history can never
  quietly read as a complete one.
- **Coverage caveat.** Rows come from the same best-effort activity-event
  stream the dashboard folds (`try_send`, dropped on a full channel). This is
  faithful metering of observed completions, not an independent billing
  ledger. Write failures are counted and surfaced instead of being swallowed.
- **HTTP surface (admin):** `GET /llmux/keys/usage?window=<all|1h|24h|7d|14d|30d|90d>&models=<a,b,c>`
  — `models` is one comma-separated, percent-encoded parameter; absent means
  every model. An unknown window is a `400`. The answer carries the applied
  `window`/`models`, the window's `available_models`, `from_ms`/`to_ms`, the
  matched `rows`, per-tenant totals with their priced per-model cells, and
  the store's `health` (`written`/`dropped`/`errors`/`last_error`/`importing`/
  `import_pct`). The
  attach-mode dashboard renders exactly this document, so local and remote
  show identical rows.

## Daemon and dashboard

Only one process can own port 3456 — normally the background daemon created by `llmux run`. To inspect it:

- `llmux dashboard` polls `GET /llmux/dashboard` once a second and renders the same view model the in-process TUI uses. Dropped connections show a reconnecting banner and keep retrying.
- `llmux server`, when a llmux daemon already owns the port, prints `daemon already running (pid N) — attaching…` and enters attach mode instead of failing with `Address already in use`.
- A foreign process on the port remains a clean error and is never overwritten.

Both attach paths are read-only except manual switching through the gated loopback control endpoint.

## Demo, recording, and privacy modes

Recording a demo or sharing your screen? Set `LLMUX_DEMO_MODE=1` and the dashboard, status, and logs show **stable fake emails** in place of your real account names. Config writes are suppressed so the aliases never touch disk.

The Islands app has the same masking via `--demo` or `LLMUX_ISLANDS_DEMO=1`; it also opens and holds the notch panel open for recording.

For persistent masking, `email_anonymous` in the config masks every email surface — TUI render and Islands mosaic — and can be flipped live from the Islands ☰ menu or `POST /llmux/settings`.

Two demo GIFs are regenerated at deploy time and attached to each release:

- **CLI / TUI** — [`demo/llmux.tape`](../demo/llmux.tape) (vhs) → [`llmux-demo.gif`](https://github.com/2lab-ai/llmux/releases/latest/download/llmux-demo.gif)
- **Islands app** — `--demo` capture → [`llmux-islands-demo.gif`](https://github.com/2lab-ai/llmux/releases/latest/download/llmux-islands-demo.gif)

Recorders live in [`demo/`](../demo/): `record-cli.sh`, `record-islands.sh`, and `record-all.sh` (records both + `gh release upload`). The app capture needs a one-time macOS **Screen Recording** grant for the terminal you run it from.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.config/llmux.json` by default, respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and can be overridden with `$LLMUX_CONFIG`. File mode is `0600`. Writes are atomic read-merge-write so the server and CLI can update concurrently.

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the full config reference.

Codex request-shaping is also settable live from the dashboard's Codex group: `default_model` (the model slug sent upstream, default `gpt-5.6-sol`), `fast` (sends `service_tier: "priority"` when `true`), and `reasoning_effort` (`none`|`minimal`|`low`|`medium`|`high`|`xhigh`|`max`, plus `ultra` on `gpt-5.6-sol`/`-terra`; `max`/`ultra` clamp to `xhigh` below the gpt-5.6 family; omitted by default). Grok request-shaping is the same minus `fast` (xAI has no service tier): `default_model` (default `grok-4.7`) and `reasoning_effort` (`none`|`low`|`medium`|`high`|`xhigh`, clamped per model at request time; omitted by default).

Accounts are `oauth` (Claude subscription), `apikey` (Anthropic API key), `codex` (ChatGPT/Codex subscription token), `grok` (xAI subscription token), or `openrouter` (an `sk-or-v1-…` API key). Claude accounts dedupe by `account_uuid`; Codex accounts dedupe by `account_id`; API keys and OpenRouter accounts dedupe by name. An `lm-...` proxy API key is generated on first run; localhost clients are exempt.

`email_anonymous` (default `false`) masks account emails on every display surface. The TUI render layer uses the same stable fake-email mapping as demo mode, and llmux Islands pixelizes emails in its Usage panel. The value is served in `GET /llmux/status` and can be flipped live via `POST /llmux/settings {"email_anonymous": true}` or the Islands ☰ toggle.

## Activity feed

The dashboard's activity panel shows one row per request — running requests
pinned on top, then completed ones newest first
(2026-07-15 layout):

```text
▸ HH:MM:SS  kind  name  [model effort]  email…(10) → 200 3.1s 269tok $0.0079 «session» "input text to the screen edge"
```

- **name** — who sent it: the client-key name for keyed requests, the
  builtin bucket id for keyless traffic, shortened to the first
  whitespace-separated token's first 4 chars (`Z (U09…)` → `Z`,
  `angelo (U0…)` → `ange`, `local` → `loca`). Blank for history persisted
  before tenant attribution existed — never coerced to `local`. The
  expanded detail's `name` line keeps the full name plus the tenant id.
- **kind** — what the request was, classified once at forward entry from the
  buffered body: `user`, `count` (count_tokens), `security`, `compact`,
  `summary`, `title`, `suggest`, `audit`, `subagent`, `sdk`, plus two
  harness control pings — `quota` (Claude Code's per-session rate-limit
  probe: a bare `"quota"` turn with `max_tokens: 1`) and `recap` ("The user
  stepped away…"). See
  [system-prompts/families.md](system-prompts/families.md) for the wire
  fingerprints.
- **badge** — `[model effort]`, group conveyed by color; the vendor prefix
  is stripped (`claude-opus-4-8[1m]` → `opus-4-8[1m]`). Columns are padded
  to the widest visible value per frame, and the input excerpt takes the
  remaining terminal width.
- **in flight** — a RUNNING request renders the same columns, so nothing
  shifts when it finishes: a group-colored spinner in place of `▸`, `…` in
  the status slot, the live elapsed time in the duration slot, and `—` for
  tokens/throughput/cost. Name, badge and email therefore line up with the
  completed rows, and the «session» label plus the "input" excerpt are already
  there while the request runs — both are known at forward entry, not at the
  finish.
- **Clicking a row** expands its detail lines (full method+path, client id,
  account, token/cost breakdown). Clicking again collapses.
- **Grouping** — only consecutive `count` probes fold, into
  `▸ HH:MM:SS count N× …` (start time). The leading `▸` marker toggles the
  fold; clicking the header body only ever expands; clicking a member row
  inside an open fold expands that member's own detail instead of closing
  the group.
- **Infinite scroll** — wheel/arrow scrolling past the in-memory window
  hydrates the persisted `activity.jsonl` in the background and pages older
  rows in on demand. Works for the in-process TUI and loopback attach; a
  cross-host attach deliberately refuses local-file history (the file
  belongs to a different daemon) until a remote paging endpoint exists.

Two request-handling behaviors keep the feed honest at session start:
`HEAD|GET /` (Claude Code's base-URL reachability check) is answered locally
with 200 instead of being forwarded upstream to a guaranteed 404, and a
`quota` probe gets exactly one upstream attempt — no failover sweep across
the pool, no exhaustion park — so a rate-limited moment paints one line, not
one per account.

### Raw request/response viewer

An expanded entry's `🔍 request` detail line opens a DevTools-style modal
over the dashboard with the request's captured payloads (from
`raw-io.jsonl`; see `raw_io` in [configuration.md](configuration.md)).

- **Tabs follow the wire.** A translated (codex/grok) exchange shows all
  four legs — `Request` (client → llmux) → `Upstream Req` (the rewritten
  Responses-API request llmux sent) → `Upstream Resp` (the provider's
  verbatim reply before conversion) → `Response` (what the client
  received). A byte-identity Anthropic passthrough shows the classic 2 tabs
  (client and upstream exchange are the same bytes). Click a tab or walk
  with `←`/`→`/`Tab`/`h`/`l`.
- **Scrolling.** `↑`/`↓`/`j`/`k`, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `Home`/`End`, and the
  wheel scroll vertically; `H`/`L` (or a horizontal wheel) pan sideways.
  Proportional scrollbars render on the right and bottom edges when the
  content overflows.
- **Action buttons** (top-right, click or key): `copy` (`c`) puts the
  active tab's raw body on the system clipboard; `copy as curl` (`C`)
  reconstructs a replayable curl for that tab's side of the exchange
  (redacted credential values stay `•••redacted` — substitute your own);
  `copy all` (`a`) copies every leg with section markers; `save` (`s`) /
  `save all` (`S`) write the body / the whole record JSON to `~/Downloads`
  (timestamped). Clipboard uses `pbcopy`/`wl-copy`/`xclip`/`xsel` when
  available, falling back to the OSC 52 terminal escape; the outcome
  flashes on the modal's hint line.
- `Esc`/`q`/`Enter` closes. Records written by a daemon predating a field
  render it as "(not captured)"; passthrough records carry no upstream
  half by design.

## Scheduling model

Each account tracks two quota windows: 5-hour session and 7-day weekly. Anthropic accounts get passive data from upstream response headers plus active OAuth usage polling; Codex accounts ingest `x-codex-*` headers when present. Selection is pure and deterministic over a snapshot, re-evaluated when the current account becomes ineligible and on a 60-second tick — never per request.

1. **Eligibility gate.** Keep accounts with healthy auth, no active 429 park, both windows under their thresholds, and fresh-enough usage data. A degraded headers-only mode kicks in if every account's usage is stale.
2. **Score = usable burst now × perishability.** `servable_now = min(5h headroom, 7d headroom)` is what an account can serve before it next gates on either limit. `urgency` ramps up the closer an account is to its 7-day reset, linearly across the week and capped at 4×. So `score = servable_now × urgency` prefers quota that is **about to reset and would otherwise evaporate unused**, but only while it is still usable.
3. **Sticky, with a perishability override.** Stay on the current account while it is eligible — unless another account is clearly worth more, currently 25% above the current score. This protects upstream prompt-cache locality while still burning soon-to-reset quota.
4. **Backend grouping.** With routing on by default, only same-group accounts compete and each group keeps its own sticky pick. With routing off, Codex accounts rank last as a cross-group overflow pool.
5. **Exhaustion.** Honor `retry-after` on 429. If every account is exhausted, return 429 with the soonest window reset as `retry-after`.

The full derivation, edge cases, and the wasted-quota simulation that validates this policy live in [`.prd/09-scheduler-perishability.md`](../.prd/09-scheduler-perishability.md).

## Model routing

By default (`routing.enabled = true`) the request's `model` selects the backend **group**:

- **claude group** — `oauth` + `apikey` accounts; models `claude-*`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable-5`.
- **codex group** — `codex` accounts; models `gpt-*`, `gpt-5.5`, `codex`, `o1`/`o3`/`o4`.
- **grok group** — `grok` accounts; models `grok`, `grok-*`.
- **openrouter group** — `openrouter` accounts; models `or-*`, a bare `or`, and `openrouter/*`.

Within the matched group the scheduler picks the best eligible account, sticky **per group**. The Claude pick and the Codex pick advance independently. An unrecognized or absent model falls back to `default_group`.

Turn routing **off** (`routing.enabled = false`) for the older behavior: the `model` is ignored for selection and Codex accounts become a cross-group overflow pool. A request lands on the best Claude/API account and only spills to Codex when every Claude account is exhausted.

```json
"routing": {
  "enabled": true,
  "claude_models": [],
  "codex_models": [],
  "grok_models": [],
  "openrouter_models": [],
  "default_group": "claude",
  "on_empty_group": "error"
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | On = model→group routing; off = Codex-as-overflow behavior. |
| `claude_models` | `[]` | Models routed to the Claude group. Empty keeps the builtin rules; a non-empty list replaces them. |
| `codex_models` | `[]` | Models routed to the Codex group with the same semantics. |
| `grok_models` | `[]` | Models routed to the Grok group with the same semantics. |
| `openrouter_models` | `[]` | Models routed to the OpenRouter group with the same semantics. Empty keeps the builtin `or-` prefix, exact `or`, and `openrouter/` prefix rules. |
| `default_group` | `"claude"` | Group for an unmatched or model-less request: `"claude"`, `"codex"`, `"grok"`, or `"openrouter"`. |
| `on_empty_group` | `"error"` | When the matched group has no configured account: `"error"` returns a 404 `not_found_error`; `"fallback"` tries the remaining groups in the fixed `claude → codex → grok → openrouter` order and the first group with an account serves the request. |

Override tokens in the per-group model lists are matched in order, first-match-wins, case-insensitively. A bare token is a **prefix** (`"gpt-"`); prefix it with `~` for a **substring** (`"~codex"`) or `=` for an **exact** match (`"=gpt-5.5"`).

### Selecting the Codex model from Claude Code

The inbound `model` string **is** the selector — point Claude Code's model at a Codex-group model and the proxy routes the request to a Codex account:

```bash
# Per-session: route this Claude Code session's requests to the Codex group
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=gpt-5.5 claude
```

or set the model in Claude Code's own model setting:

```text
/model gpt-5.5
/model gpt-5.5[1m]
```

For account *selection*, the model string's only job is to choose the group. Any `gpt-*` / `codex` / `o1`–`o4` string that classifies to the Codex group is routed there. The model actually sent upstream is the one you asked for whenever llmux recognizes it: the known codex ids (`gpt-5.6-sol` / `-terra` / `-luna`, `gpt-5.5`, …) pass through verbatim, the bare aliases resolve (`sol` → `gpt-5.6-sol`, bare `gpt-5.6` → the sol flagship), and a trailing `[1m]` is stripped before the request leaves llmux, so `gpt-5.6-terra[1m]` reaches the backend as `gpt-5.6-terra`. Only an unrecognized id or a model-less request falls back to `codex.default_model` (default `gpt-5.6-sol`), set in config or live from the dashboard. `/llmux/status` reports the per-group current accounts under `current_by_group` and keeps a representative scalar `current` for back-compat.

### Context-window display for Codex models

When you route to the Codex group with a bare `gpt-5.5`, Claude Code's **remaining context** indicator is wrong because the client computes the window from the **model-name string**. llmux can route and stream the request, but it cannot set Claude Code's local context-window table:

- Claude Code derives the context **window** from the model name, client-side.
- Bare `gpt-5.5` can fall back to a **200,000** token window in Claude Code.
- The Codex `gpt-5.5` backend window is larger, and `gpt-5.5[1m]` makes Claude Code display a **1,000,000** token window.
- No `/v1/messages` response field or endpoint lets the proxy set the client's context window.

Use the `[1m]` suffix when you want Claude Code to display a 1M window:

```text
/model gpt-5.5[1m]
```

`gpt-5.5[1m]` still routes to the Codex group: the `gpt-` prefix still matches, and the suffix is stripped for routing/usage attribution — and, since 2026-08-21, on the codex request path too, so the suffix works on any codex id or alias (`gpt-5.6-sol[1m]`, `sol[1m]`) without degrading to the pin.

How much a 1M display over-reports depends on the model. For the gpt-5.6 family it is modest: probes 2026-08-21 against the ChatGPT-account backend accepted **910,229** input tokens on `gpt-5.6-sol` and were rejected at ~936k, and OpenAI publishes 1,050,000 total for the family — which is why `gpt-5.6-sol[1m]` / `gpt-5.6-terra[1m]` are catalog rows (see [models.md](models.md#the-codex-1m-rows)). For `gpt-5.5` (a 272k model) the 1M display remains a pure client-side workaround, not a promise that every long transcript will be accepted unchanged.

If a long session still blocks near the mid-200k range, use the empirical compaction workaround in [FAQ: gpt-5.5 context stops around 265k](faq.md#gpt-55-stops-around-265k-context-what-should-i-do).

## Codex backend

A ChatGPT/Codex subscription credential can be added with `llmux login --codex` (browser OAuth, falling back to importing `~/.codex/auth.json`) or imported directly:

```bash
llmux import --from ~/.codex/auth.json
```

The Codex provider translates Claude Code Messages requests into the Codex Responses backend and converts the stream back into Anthropic Messages SSE (or an aggregated Messages JSON response for `stream: false`). The upstream model, a fast (`priority`) service tier, and reasoning effort are configurable (`codex.default_model` / `codex.fast` / `codex.reasoning_effort`) and adjustable live from the dashboard (`m` / `f` / `e`). Text, reasoning summaries, ordinary client-defined tools, and the bounded image subset below are supported. `/v1/messages/count_tokens` is answered locally; other non-`/v1/messages` endpoints return a clear 501.

### Codex / Grok compatibility contract

These are **subscription gateways**, not the public OpenAI or xAI API: Codex uses `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`; Grok uses `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/responses`. Shared Responses syntax does not imply identical capabilities or budgets. Anthropic and OpenRouter passthrough behavior is unchanged by this contract; unsupported translated input is not a reason to silently fall back to another provider.

| Messages input / behavior | Codex | Grok |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User PNG/JPEG/**WebP** base64 images | Supported as `input_image.image_url` data URIs, bytes forwarded verbatim | Same |
| User **GIF** base64 images | Forwarded verbatim — the gateway accepts GIF (live probe 2026-09-17) | Decoded and re-encoded as PNG; this gateway answers a GIF with `400 invalid_image` |
| Animated GIF | Forwarded verbatim, all frames intact (nothing is parsed) | Local HTTP 400; a PNG cannot carry the frames and llmux will not forward only the first |
| Images nested in user `tool_result.content` | Supported in `function_call_output.output` content arrays, preserving text/image order | Same (a GIF is converted in place) |
| URL images, other media, unknown content blocks | Local HTTP 400; never fetched or silently dropped | Same |
| `tool_choice` | `auto` → `"auto"`; `any` → `"required"`; `none` → `"none"`; `tool{name}` → `{"type":"function","name":name}` | Same |
| Absent/empty tools | Omit `tools`, `tool_choice`, and `parallel_tool_calls` together (`auto`/`none` are vacuous) | Same |
| Positive-integer `max_tokens` | Omitted upstream; omission/warning `max_tokens`; strict mode returns 400 | Forwarded unchanged as `max_output_tokens`; warning `max_tokens_semantics`; strict mode returns 400 |
| Prior assistant `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` | Omitted with matching omission/warning names; strict mode returns 400 | Same |
| Top-level `thinking` configuration | Validate shape, then omit with `thinking_config` omission/warning; strict mode returns 400 | Same |
| Other generation controls | Non-null `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k` or nonempty `stop_sequences`: local 400; subscription support is unverified | Same |
| Text/tool-only `count_tokens` | Local heuristic, including serialized tool schemas/property names; `X-Llmux-Token-Count: estimate` | Same |
| Image `count_tokens` (top-level or nested) | Local HTTP 400: no reliable image-token estimate | Same |
| Process-wide `prompt_cache_key` | Retained | Omitted; routing scope of a shared key is unproven |

Image validation requires `source.type: "base64"`, nonempty valid base64, a decoded size of at most **20 MiB per image**, and a `media_type` the target gateway accepts — measured, not assumed (live probes 2026-09-17): Codex answered 200 to `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp` and `image/gif`; Grok answered 200 to the first three and refused GIF with `400 {"code":"invalid_image", … "Downloaded response does not contain a valid JPG, PNG, WebP, or ICO image."}`. Anything the gateway accepts is forwarded **byte-for-byte and never parsed**, so llmux cannot degrade an image it was not asked to change. The one conversion is **GIF on Grok**: the frame is decoded and re-encoded as PNG (transparency preserved), and the resulting PNG is subject to the same 20 MiB cap. That conversion is additionally bounded by a **128 MiB decode budget** (`width × height × 4`, checked from the GIF's logical screen descriptor before any pixel buffer is allocated, so a small file declaring huge dimensions is refused rather than decoded; this llmux-owned budget is the only size limit on the path — the `gif` backend imposes none when `image` hands it a caller-owned buffer — so an oversized image is always a typed 400 naming the dimensions, never a decoder-internal "not decodable"); an **animated** GIF (more than one frame in the container) or an undecodable one is refused outright on Grok, while Codex forwards it whole. A media type outside the gateway's set is a local 400 naming the field path, the flavor and that flavor's accepted list. Grok's own minimums (at least 8 px per side and 512 total pixels) are not enforced locally — such an image is forwarded and the gateway's 400 propagates. This is a bounded llmux contract, not support for every upstream image format. Images on assistant/system/developer roles, documents, audio/video, malformed structures, and nameless or server-side tools return a typed local 400 with a field path, not raw payload data. `tool_use` requires valid id/name/input; `tool_result` requires a nonempty `tool_use_id`, and `is_error: true` is preserved by an explicit error-text prefix. Named choices must refer to a declared tool; `any`/`tool` require nonempty tools. `disable_parallel_tool_use` must be boolean and maps to the inverse `parallel_tool_calls`; there is no fallback from an invalid choice to `auto`.

**Compatibility policy and headers.** Omit `X-Llmux-Compatibility` or send `X-Llmux-Compatibility: compat` for the default policy. It permits only the enumerated semantic losses above; it does not make unsupported content acceptable. Successful translated responses advertise sorted, deduplicated field-name lists when relevant:

- `X-Llmux-Omitted-Fields`: fields actually omitted (`max_tokens` on Codex, `thinking`, `redacted_thinking`, and `thinking_config` for top-level thinking configuration).
- `X-Llmux-Compatibility-Warnings`: omission names plus `max_tokens_semantics` on Grok. Grok's forwarded limit is **not** listed as omitted.
- A structured WARN records provider, field list, and request id. These headers/logs are machine-readable diagnostics, **not a promise that Claude Code displays a warning**.

Send `X-Llmux-Compatibility: strict` to reject any such issue with HTTP 400 **before upstream traffic or credential refresh**. Other header values and invalid/nonpositive/noninteger limits also return 400. Since normal Messages clients send `max_tokens`, strict mode will reject those Codex/Grok requests rather than pretend to enforce an equivalent budget.

**Other generation controls.** Non-null `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k`, and nonempty `stop_sequences`, are rejected locally with 400 because their subscription-gateway mapping is unverified; public API support does not establish that mapping. Empty `stop_sequences` is vacuous; malformed stop sequences return 400. Top-level `thinking` configuration is separate from prior assistant thinking blocks: its shape is validated, then the configuration is omitted with `thinking_config` in both diagnostic lists (strict mode: 400). Do not assume `budget_tokens` or disabled reasoning is enforced. Counting sends no generation controls upstream and produces no inference-only omission warnings. This is a bounded list of known controls, not a claim that every present or future Anthropic field is faithfully handled.

**Limits are not billing caps.** Codex's subscription endpoint rejected `max_output_tokens: 16` in the dated probe below; llmux does not send it, clamp it, or fake truncation. Grok accepted that field and stopped at an observed 16 non-reasoning output tokens, but reported **302 output tokens including 286 reasoning tokens**. That is evidence of a visible-output cap for that fixture, not an Anthropic-equivalent total-generation budget or a billing guarantee. Reasoning usage can be additional to the requested visible output. A `response.incomplete` (or a `response.completed` envelope with `status: "incomplete"`) whose reason is `max_output_tokens` maps to Messages `stop_reason: "max_tokens"`, retaining partial text and usage. Other incomplete reasons become an Anthropic error event for SSE or HTTP 502 for aggregate JSON. Truncated tool arguments must never be repaired to an executable `{}` call; clients must not execute incomplete tool calls.

**No private reasoning continuity.** Remaining text/tool history is preserved when prior assistant thinking is omitted. Neither provider's foreign thinking signatures are converted into upstream ciphertext. There is no ciphertext cache or private-reasoning replay in this version; returned reasoning summaries are not a continuity mechanism. Thinking blocks in other roles are rejected. Grok's process-wide cache key is removed because the public reference describes routing through `x-grok-conv-id`, not because a cross-session data leak was established. Upstream text is relayed verbatim, including literal XML or artifact-looking text; there is no heuristic output scrub. Reported output usage retains the upstream total including reasoning, without subtracting reasoning or clamping it to the requested limit.

**Counting is an estimate, not upstream usage.** For validated text/tool-only input, the heuristic sums string characters under system/messages and compact serialized tool JSON (including keys), divides by four, and floors the result at one. It is not a model tokenizer. Malformed JSON/structures and image requests return 400 instead of a plausible-looking count; Codex/Grok counting uses no upstream call or credential refresh. The estimate marker does not apply a new contract to OpenRouter's existing local count path.

### Compatibility evidence and scope

The following official sources were inspected on **2026-09-11**. OpenAI source links are pinned to Codex `rust-v0.154.0`, commit `6b9826e3aa83b1a5947db50f4332cb9c65f1b340`; xAI URLs are live documents, so the fetched OpenAPI snapshot is identified by SHA-256 `492ae8625849e4f8bffdc576cead51856a41c874a3ccaab59a3aa0b704e1653f`.

- [Codex request struct](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/6b9826e3aa83b1a5947db50f4332cb9c65f1b340/codex-rs/codex-api/src/common.rs#L281-L307) has no `max_output_tokens`. Its string-typed tool choice alone is not proof of named-choice support.
- [Codex image content](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/6b9826e3aa83b1a5947db50f4332cb9c65f1b340/codex-rs/protocol/src/models.rs#L856-L874) and [tool-result image content](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/6b9826e3aa83b1a5947db50f4332cb9c65f1b340/codex-rs/protocol/src/models.rs#L2055-L2070) define the wire shapes.
- [xAI Responses reference](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/inference/responses.md), [OpenAPI schema](https://docs.x.ai/openapi.json) (`ModelToolChoice`, `FunctionToolCallOutput`, `ModelRequest`), and [image guide](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/images/understanding.md) document flat named choices, multimodal tool outputs, PNG/JPEG, and the 20 MiB limit. These describe **api.x.ai**, not a guaranteed subscription-gateway contract. In particular, the public reference says the output limit includes reasoning; the gateway fixture below does not demonstrate that equivalence.

Synthetic gateway probes on **2026-09-11**, models **`gpt-5.6-sol`** and **`grok-4.6`**, observed: user PNG + flat named choice returned `report_color(red)`; `required` returned a function call; nested tool-result PNG returned blue; `none` returned `OK` without calls. Codex rejected the cap field with 400; Grok produced the incomplete/usage result above. These are single observed fixtures per case, not universal model/version guarantees, JPEG-specific live proof, or proof that named choice excludes additional prose. Raw account identifiers, transcripts, and credentials are deliberately not reproduced.

## OpenRouter backend

Add an OpenRouter account with the browser OAuth PKCE flow:

```bash
llmux login --openrouter
```

llmux opens `https://openrouter.ai/auth`, takes the callback on a localhost port, and exchanges the code for a long-lived `sk-or-v1-…` API key. There is **no token refresh**: the exchange yields an API key rather than an expiring access token, so the credential is never rotated. The account is named `or:<key label>` (the label comes from `GET /api/v1/key`), or `or:key-N` when no label is available.

If a browser cannot be opened, the callback times out (2 minutes), or the local port cannot be bound, the flow degrades to a key prompt on its own. You can also ask for that prompt up front — it is the way to reuse a key you already have:

```bash
llmux login --openrouter --paste
```

`--paste` requires `--openrouter`. The key is read from stdin, never printed back, and is masked in logs like every other credential.

Unlike the Codex and Grok backends, the OpenRouter provider is a **passthrough, not a translator**: OpenRouter exposes a native Anthropic Messages endpoint (`POST {openrouter.upstream}/messages`), so the Messages format is not converted and there is no SSE conversion on this path. The body is still normalized twice, not forwarded byte-for-byte: the `model` field is rewritten to the wire slug, and `thinking` blocks with a missing or empty `signature` — the ones the Codex/Grok translators synthesize — are stripped, dropping any message the strip leaves with an empty content array, because OpenRouter's Messages schema requires that signature. The Claude-Code-local `anthropic-beta` / `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` headers are also dropped. `/v1/messages/count_tokens` is answered locally (OpenRouter has no equivalent endpoint). The per-backend difference matrix is [provider compatibility](provider-compatibility.md).

Model selection is the `or-` prefix — `/model or-ox-alpha` routes to the openrouter group and reaches OpenRouter as `stealth/ox-alpha`. A bare `or` (or a model-less request) uses `openrouter.default_model`, `or-<vendor>/<slug>` passes through verbatim for the models llmux does not curate, and an unrecognized bare name is forwarded as typed so OpenRouter's own 404 reaches you. The curated rows, their wire slugs, and their context windows are in [models.md](models.md#alias-semantics).

Cost: the ten curated models are free (`$0` in and out). An uncurated openrouter model has **no known rate** — the usage tab shows `—` and marks the bucket `+?` rather than pricing it as free, because the same group also fronts OpenRouter's paid catalog.
