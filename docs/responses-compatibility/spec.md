# Responses request compatibility — spec (codex + grok)

What an Anthropic Messages request becomes on the two Responses backends llmux speaks to,
and what happens to the parts that do not fit. Implementation:
`src/provider/responses_request.rs`. Response-side (terminal events, counting) lives in
[`trace.md`](trace.md) and `src/provider/responses.rs`.

**The rule this document exists to state: llmux never silently drops request content.**
Before this unit, images, nested tool-result images, `tool_choice`, `max_tokens`, unknown
content blocks and nameless tools all disappeared into a `debug!`/`warn!` line the client
never sees — the model then answered a question it was never shown. Now each of those is
either converted, or refused with a typed error naming the JSON path, or (for the two
losses the wire makes unavoidable) reported in response headers.

## 1. Endpoints and evidence

| Backend | Upstream | Flavor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| codex | `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` (ChatGPT subscription) | `ResponsesFlavor::Codex` |
| grok | `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/responses` (Grok subscription) | `ResponsesFlavor::Grok` |

Neither is the vendor's public API, so public API docs are a hypothesis, not a receipt.
Live probes against both endpoints (2026-09-11, synthetic fixtures — no user data):

| Probe | codex | grok |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base64 PNG `input_image` + flat named `tool_choice` | 200, `function_call report_color({"color":"red"})` | 200, same call |
| `tool_choice` `required` | 200, a function call | 200, a function call |
| image nested in `function_call_output.output` array | 200, answered from the image | 200, answered from the image |
| `tool_choice` `none` | 200, zero calls | 200, zero calls |
| `max_output_tokens: 16` | **400 `Unsupported parameter: max_output_tokens`** | 200 `status:incomplete`, `incomplete_details.reason: max_output_tokens`, usage reports `output_tokens: 302` of which `reasoning_tokens: 286` |

Re-probed 2026-09-14 with the smallest possible cap, `max_output_tokens: 1`: codex answered
`400 {"detail":"Unsupported parameter: max_output_tokens"}` again; grok answered 200
`status:incomplete` / `incomplete_details.reason: max_output_tokens` with visible output
and `output_tokens: 168` of which `reasoning_tokens: 167`.

The cap probe shows wire ACCEPTANCE and the visible-output effect on that one request. It
does **not** prove the cap bounds the same total the Anthropic client means by
`max_tokens` (the reported reasoning tokens are additional to the visible ones), and it
says nothing about billing.

What the codex 400 licenses is narrow: `max_output_tokens` is refused. Whether that backend
accepts some OTHER output-cap parameter is **unmeasured** here — no alternative field has
been probed, so its absence from this document is not evidence that none exists.

The per-flavor **image** format receipts (both gateways probed with all four media types
Anthropic accepts, 2026-09-17) live with the rule they justify, in §R1a.

**400** = `ProviderError::InvalidRequest` → HTTP 400 from llmux itself: no upstream call, no
credential refresh, no provider-failure score.

## 3. The rules

### R1 — content

- An image becomes `{"type":"input_image","image_url":"data:<media_type>;base64,<data>"}` —
  the flat string form both endpoints accept, never the Chat-Completions nesting. `detail`
  is not sent (the reference codex client strips it; its accepted values are model-gated).
- **Order is preserved.** Text and images interleave inside ONE message item's `content`
  array in transcript order; consecutive text blocks still join with `\n`, so a text-only
  message is byte-identical to what the previous translator produced.
- `tool_result` output stays a plain string when it is text only (the historical shape) and
  becomes the `[{"type":"input_text"…},{"type":"input_image"…}]` array only when it carries
  an image.
- `is_error: true` prefixes the output with `[llmux:tool-result-error]`. Responses has no
  error flag on `function_call_output`, and a failed tool result that reads as a successful
  one makes the model report success it never got.
- Validation is structural only. A `tool_use`'s `input` is the tool's OWN arbitrary JSON:
  it is serialized verbatim and never walked for content blocks, so a tool argument that
  happens to contain `{"type":"image"}` is payload, not structure. An ABSENT `input` keeps
  the previous translator's `{}` (a genuine no-arg call); an explicit `null` or a non-object
  is refused rather than stringified into `"null"`.
- No URL is ever fetched. Inlining a remote image would make llmux an SSRF proxy for its
  clients, and the reference codex client refuses remote image URLs outright.
- Error messages carry the JSON path (`messages[2].content[1].source.data`) and never the
  payload — a 20 MiB base64 blob must not reach a log. Over-cap images are refused from
  their ENCODED length, before any decode.

### R1a — Image formats

Anthropic's Messages API accepts exactly **jpeg, png, gif, webp**, so those four are every
image a client can legally send. What each gateway does with them was measured, not
assumed — live probes 2026-09-17 with synthetic fixtures, no user data:

| `input_image` media type | codex | grok |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `image/png` | 200, reply `OK` | 200, reply `OK` |
| `image/jpeg` | 200, reply `OK` | 200, reply `OK` |
| `image/webp` | 200, reply `OK` | 200, reply `OK` |
| `image/gif` | 200, reply `OK` | **400** `{"code":"invalid_image","error":"code: 'Client specified an invalid argument', message: \"Downloaded response does not contain a valid JPG, PNG, WebP, or ICO image."}` |

So the accepted set is per flavor, and llmux's policy follows it exactly:

| Flavor | Forwarded byte-for-byte | Re-encoded as PNG |
| --- | --- | --- |
| codex | png, jpeg, webp, gif | — |
| grok | png, jpeg, webp | gif |

**Passthrough is the default, and it is the point.** An accepted media type is not decoded
at all: the client's own base64 is reused, so the bytes upstream are the bytes the client
sent. A payload llmux never parses is one it cannot be broken by, and an image it never
re-encodes is one it cannot degrade. The "unsupported image" 400 users saw before this
unit came from llmux's own png/jpeg allowlist, not from either gateway.

llmux converts only where Anthropic accepts a format the gateway does not — today exactly
**GIF on grok**. Relabelling `image/gif` as `image/png` would not be a fix and is not what
happens: the backend parses the bytes, not the label. The GIF's composited RGBA frame is
really decoded and really re-encoded, transparent index included, so alpha survives.

Three refusals guard that conversion, each **before** the memory it protects is allocated.
They apply on grok only; on codex the same GIF is forwarded without being parsed:

| Case | Why refused | Error path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| animated GIF | one PNG cannot carry the frames; forwarding frame 0 would substitute a still the user never sent. `image` will not answer "how many frames" (`GifDecoder::read_image` composites frame 0 and returns `Ok`), so llmux walks the container's own block chain — a truncated chain counts as unknown, not as one frame | `….source.data` |
| declared `width × height × 4` > **128 MiB** | a 99-byte GIF can declare 65535×65535 in its logical screen descriptor (a 16 GiB frame) — the 20 MiB compressed cap sees none of that. This is the only size limit on the path (the `gif` backend's 50 MB per-frame default is not consulted when `image` hands it a caller-owned buffer), so the refusal is always llmux's typed 400 naming the dimensions, never a decoder-internal "not decodable" that blames the payload | `….source` |
| PNG would exceed **20 MiB** | enforced by the writer *during* encoding, so the oversized buffer is never finished | `….content[n]` |
| undecodable / truncated GIF | nothing to convert | `….source.data` |

A media type outside the flavor's accepted set is a 400 naming the field path, the flavor
and what that flavor would have taken:
`messages[0].content[0].source.media_type: unsupported image media type \`image/bmp\`
(codex accepts png, jpeg, webp, gif)`.

Grok also rejects images under 512 total pixels ("Image has 256 total pixels (16x16), which
is below the minimum of 512") and dimensions under 8 px. That is the gateway's own rule,
not llmux's: such an image is forwarded and the upstream 400 propagates, exactly as today.

**Cost.** `validate_request` (the pre-refresh gate) and `build_responses_body` (the
provider) each run the full conversion, so a grok-bound GIF is decoded and re-encoded
**twice per request** — bounded by the same per-image budgets, entirely local, and always
before any upstream call. Every other (flavor, format) pair pays nothing, because nothing
is decoded. Removing the second pass means threading the converted body from the gate into
the provider, which is a `src/proxy/forward.rs` change and not part of this unit.

### R2 — tools

`tools`, `tool_choice` and `parallel_tool_calls` travel as a trio: **with no tools (absent
or empty), all three are omitted on BOTH flavors.** Without tools `auto`/`none` are
vacuous, there is nothing to parallelize, and xAI is documented to reject a `tool_choice`
with no tools. Validation still runs first, so `{"type":"any"}` with no tools is an error,
not a vacuous omission.

A tool entry with no `name` is refused. Dropping it (the old behavior) leaves the model
believing in a capability that silently does not exist; llmux cannot forward or execute a
server-side tool, and will not invent one.

### R3 — `max_tokens`

Codex cannot take an output cap at all (the 400 above), so the field is omitted and named
in the report. Grok takes it as `max_output_tokens`, forwarded verbatim with the
`max_tokens_semantics` warning because budget equivalence is unproven (§1).

llmux never fakes the cap it could not forward: no local truncation, no clamping, no
synthesized `max_tokens` stop. An invalid value is refused rather than repaired — a client
that asked for `max_tokens: 0` has a bug worth seeing.

Absent and `null` are **not** the same thing. An absent `max_tokens` is a no-cap body (what
the codex idle probe and `count_tokens` send) and is legal. An explicit
`"max_tokens": null` is a limit the client did send and is not a positive integer, so it is
refused — treating it as absent would silently omit a field the client wrote, which is the
class of loss this module exists to stop.

### R4 — prior reasoning

Assistant `thinking` / `redacted_thinking` blocks are omitted and reported; the rest of the
turn keeps its order and its text. An Anthropic `signature` is not either backend's
reasoning ciphertext, and **llmux implements no replay or provenance bridge in v1** —
neither backend's own encrypted reasoning is stored or replayed here. Consequence, stated
plainly: **there is no reasoning continuity across turns on codex/grok.** Ordinary
multi-turn text and tool transcripts are unaffected.

`prompt_cache_key` (a process-wide id) is sent on codex only. cli-chat-proxy documents no
routing scope for the key, so grok no longer asserts a session grouping llmux cannot back
with evidence. This is a claim-avoidance choice, not a report of a leak.

### R5 — the report

```rust
CompatibilityReport { omitted_fields: Vec<&'static str>, warnings: Vec<&'static str> }
```

`omitted_fields` = fields NOT forwarded (`max_tokens`, `thinking`, `redacted_thinking`,
`thinking_config`).
`warnings` = that set plus caveats that omit nothing (today `max_tokens_semantics`). Both
are sorted and deduped, so a transcript with twenty thinking blocks reports `thinking`
once and the header value is stable request to request.

The proxy turns the report into `X-Llmux-Omitted-Fields` / `X-Llmux-Compatibility-Warnings`
and a structured WARN log (`src/proxy/forward.rs`). Those are **machine-readable
warnings, not a user-visible error** — which is exactly why unsupported content is a 400
instead of a warning: a header cannot carry "your image never arrived".

### R6 — counting

`validate_request(…, count_tokens = true)` applies the same structural checks, refuses
images (no honest image-token estimate exists — base64 length is not a token count), and
skips the inference-only issues (`max_tokens`, `thinking_config`), since counting sends no
output budget or generation control anywhere. Their SHAPE is still validated: a misspelled
`thinking` config is a client bug worth reporting on either endpoint.

### R7 — generation controls

`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k` and `stop_sequences` were read by nothing before this unit:
the turn ran at the backend default while the client believed it had set a value. Neither
subscription endpoint's acceptance of them is verified — the public vendor APIs are not
these endpoints — so a non-null sampling control or a non-empty `stop_sequences` is a local
400 rather than a forward-on-assumption or a silent ignore. llmux does not emulate stop
sequences locally either. An explicit `null` control and an EMPTY `stop_sequences` array
ask for nothing and are accepted; a `stop_sequences` that is not an array is malformed.

The top-level `thinking` **config** is a different object from the per-message `thinking`
history blocks of R4, hence its own report name `thinking_config`. Its shape is validated
(`enabled` requires a positive-integer `budget_tokens`; `adaptive` and `disabled` stand
alone) and then it is dropped and reported. It is never translated: mapping `budget_tokens`
onto a `reasoning.effort` would invent a correspondence neither backend documents.

**No budget and no disable guarantee.** `thinking: {"type": "disabled"}` does NOT stop the
backend from reasoning (grok-4.6 documents that reasoning cannot be turned off), and a
`budget_tokens` bounds nothing upstream. Reasoning effort on these backends comes from
llmux's own per-request resolution (`config.codex` / `config.grok`, `output_config.effort`),
not from this field; the proxy reads it only for an activity-log label.

This rule closes the controls known today. It is not a claim that every future Anthropic
request field is handled — a new one would land in whatever branch matches it, which is
why unknown CONTENT is refused rather than ignored.

## 4. API

```rust
pub enum ResponsesFlavor { Codex, Grok }

pub fn validate_request(body: &Value, flavor: ResponsesFlavor, count_tokens: bool)
    -> Result<CompatibilityReport, ProviderError>;

pub fn build_responses_body(body: &Value, plan: &RequestPlan<'_>, flavor: ResponsesFlavor)
    -> Result<(Value, bool), ProviderError>;
```

Both run the SAME conversion, so a body that validates cannot fail to build and vice
versa; `build_responses_body` validates internally, so a direct caller cannot bypass the
checks. Re-exported through `provider::responses` (one import path for the shared
machinery); the adapters (`codex.rs`, `grok.rs`) pass their flavor at the one call site
each.

**Deviation from the shared-API sketch:** flavor is a third ARGUMENT rather than a
`RequestPlan` field. `RequestPlan` is adapter-resolved request shape (model, effort, tier);
the flavor is fixed per adapter and needed by validation, which has no plan. One argument
at one call site per adapter is the smaller surface, and it keeps `RequestPlan` unchanged
for the response-side owner.

## 5. Not in this unit

- **Terminal/output semantics** (`response.incomplete` → `max_tokens`, output identity,
  usage totals) — [`trace.md`](trace.md) and the converter owner. In particular
  `output_tokens` is the upstream total INCLUDING reasoning and is never reduced to the
  client's `max_tokens`.
- **The HTTP policy layer** — `X-Llmux-Compatibility: compat|strict`, header emission, the
  400 mapping for `InvalidRequest`, and the count endpoint's response — `src/proxy/forward.rs`.
- **Idle probe** — `src/proxy/idle_probe.rs` builds its codex probe through this translator
  and must construct a no-cap body rather than pretend a one-token budget.
- **Reasoning replay.** A provider-tagged encrypted-reasoning envelope (codex can carry
  one) would restore continuity; it needs its own provenance design and is deliberately
  absent here. No cross-provider crossover, ever.
- **Docs owned elsewhere:** `docs/README.md` (index row for this directory),
  `docs/operational-reference.md` (user-visible codex behavior), `docs/grok/spec.md`
  (records `prompt_cache_key` as sent — now codex-only). Owed by whoever lands the branch.
