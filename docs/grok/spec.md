## Goal

Add **Grok (xAI) as a third backend group** to llmux — alongside `claude` and `codex` —
serving Anthropic Messages API clients (Claude Code) from a Grok subscription account via
xAI's Responses API. Registration and stats are exposed in both the CLI and
llmux-islands; the core model-switch requirement (R4) is Claude Code `/model grok-4.5`
routing. A live daemon-side model/effort override is exposed via the **daemon HTTP API**
(`POST /llmux/grok`); interactive callers for it (the TUI `f/m/e` control, an islands
settings row) are v1-descoped (§R4). Refactor so codex and grok share one Responses-API
core with thin per-provider adapters.

## Why this is safe to build on the codex skeleton (evidence)

- xAI's chat surface **is** the OpenAI Responses API: CLIProxyAPI's xAI executor posts to
  `{base}/responses` (`internal/runtime/executor/xai_executor.go:151,616`), and its xAI
  "thinking" applier literally embeds the codex applier
  (`internal/thinking/provider/xai/apply.go:12-16`).
- llmux's codex provider is already a Messages↔Responses translator ported from
  CLIProxyAPI (`src/provider/codex.rs:1-9`), with per-request model pass-through
  (`resolve_upstream_model`, codex.rs:~280) and per-request effort from the Claude Agent
  SDK's `output_config.effort` (codex.rs:319-349).

The earlier "no usage endpoint" claim was wrong: it probed /v1/{usage,rate_limits,quota,me} and grok.com/rest/rate-limits, never `/billing`. Passive `x-ratelimit-*` headers also exist (below) and remain the 5h source | xai-org/grok-build `crates/codegen/xai-grok-shell/src/extensions/billing.rs` + `credit_bar.rs`; same strings in the local grok CLI 1.0.34 binary; live capture 2026-09-17 (`creditUsagePercent: 65.0`, `USAGE_PERIOD_TYPE_WEEKLY`, period end `2026-09-22T02:19:18.817992+00:00`) |

## Requirements → design

### R1. Grok provider + `grok` backend group

- `BackendGroup` gains a third variant `Grok` (`src/routing.rs:22-26`); `from_kind`:
  credential kind `"grok"` → `Grok` (routing.rs:32-37); `as_str`/`from_label` extended.
- Builtin routing rule for the grok group: model prefix `grok` (mirrors
  builtin claude/codex rules, routing.rs:105-125). Config `routing.grok_models`
  (additive, `#[serde(default)]`) — empty keeps builtins, non-empty replaces
  (Classifier::from_config, routing.rs:151-177).
- New credential variant `AccountCredential::Grok { access_token, refresh_token,
  expires_at_ms, token_endpoint, last_refresh_ms }`. Account name convention
  `grok:{email}` (email from id_token JWT `email` claim; fallback `sub`, then epoch-ms —
  mirrors CLIProxyAPI `internal/auth/xai/token.go:71-81`).
- **OAuth token contract** (normative; C5/C8): device-code poll form =
  `grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code&device_code=…&client_id=…`
  (client_id REQUIRED — xai.go:258-262); refresh form =
  `grant_type=refresh_token&client_id=…&refresh_token=…` (xai.go:361-368). Rotation:
  a refresh response's `refresh_token`, when present, REPLACES the stored one; when
  omitted, the stored one is KEPT (llmux codex parity, forward.rs:1494-1499).
  `access_token`/`expires_at_ms`/`last_refresh_ms` swap atomically as one credential
  value (pool swap + config persist, existing `refresh_credential` shape). 401 or
  `invalid_grant` on refresh → `RefreshOutcome::Permanent` (re-login required, account
  excluded from retry ticks — existing semantics, server.rs:694,755). OIDC endpoint
  validation: https + hostname exactly `x.ai` or `*.x.ai` label-boundary suffix
  (mirror ValidateOAuthEndpoint, xai.go:47-64).
- `GrokProvider` (new `src/provider/grok.rs`): thin adapter over the shared Responses
  core (R5). `GrokShape { model: "grok-4.7" (default), client_model: Option, effort:
  Option }` — **no `fast`** (xAI has no service tier). Live-mutable behind `RwLock`
  exactly like `CodexShape` (codex.rs:96-125).
- Request shape differences vs codex (adapter knobs, not forks):
  - endpoint = `config.grok.upstream` (default `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1`) +
    `/responses`;
  - identity headers `X-XAI-Token-Auth` / `x-grok-client-version` / `User-Agent`
    attached only when upstream is the official cli-chat-proxy host;
  - **No process-wide conversation routing key**: omit both `x-grok-conv-id` and body
    `prompt_cache_key`. Correction 2026-09-11: the [official public Responses reference](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/inference/responses.md)
    describes `prompt_cache_key` as plumbed to `x-grok-conv-id` and used for routing; the
    old claim that it is a pure cache hint was not justified. Removing it avoids an unproven
    shared routing scope; neither a known data leak nor its absence has been established;
  - `service_tier` never sent; `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]` is not requested
    because this adapter has no ciphertext-replay contract/cache. xAI's public API does
    document this include option; it is **not** OpenAI-exclusive. Foreign Anthropic thinking
    signatures are never converted into xAI encrypted content;
  - effort is **per-model capability, not provider-global**: a static thinking-levels
    table (source: CLIProxyAPI registry models.json:2411-2520; `grok-4.7` /
    `grok-4.7-build-fast` from live cli-chat-proxy /v1/models 2026-09-23) —
    `grok-4.7 → {low,medium,high,xhigh}`,
    `grok-4.7-build-fast → {low,medium,high,xhigh}`,
    `grok-4.6 → {low,medium,high,xhigh}`, `grok-4.5 → {low,medium,high}`,
    `grok-4.3 → {none,low,medium,high}`,
    `grok-3-mini → {low,medium,high}`; models NOT in the table (e.g. `grok-build-0.1`,
    unknown slugs) get **no `reasoning` field at all** (omission, mirroring CLIProxyAPI's
    strip at xai_executor.go:1206-1211, debug-logged). For models in the table, the
    requested/configured effort clamps INTO the model's level set: `none|minimal` → `low`
    when zero not allowed (else `none`), `xhigh|max|ultra` → `high` (amended
    2026-08-26: conditional since #138 — `xhigh` when the model's level set has it
    (grok-4.7, grok-4.6), `high` otherwise (grok-4.5); src/provider/grok.rs:312-318). When the clamped
    result is `none` (only reachable on models whose level set contains it, e.g.
    grok-4.3), the `reasoning` field is OMITTED rather than sent as `"none"` —
    omission is this adapter's conservative wire policy; explicit `"none"` remains an
    untested subscription-gateway shape. **The per-model table is the single source of effort
    truth**: the `POST /llmux/grok` config endpoint accepts the SUPERSET
    `none|low|medium|high` (amended 2026-08-26: `xhigh` accepted since #138 —
    `is_valid_config_effort`, src/provider/grok.rs:362-364) (plus empty/`unset` to
    clear) and the per-request clamp
    against the effective model happens at request time — a configured `none` on a
    model without `none` degrades to `low` at request time, by the same clamp.
- Error handling (429): `Retry-After` header, when present, wins (existing generic
  path). Else a body whose `code`/`error` contains `free-usage-exhausted` / "included
  free usage" → park with **estimated** probe-not-before `now+24h` (xAI advertises a
  rolling 24h window — the real reset time is unknowable from the 429; surfaces render
  it as an estimate, not a hard reset). Generic 429 → existing backoff untouched.

### R2. Registration in CLI and islands

- CLI: `llmux login --grok` — device-code flow: discovery → device code → print
  `verification_uri_complete` + `user_code`, attempt `open` of the URL, poll token
  endpoint (interval/slow_down per RFC 8628, mirrors xai.go:196-328) → upsert account
  `grok:{email}`. No localhost callback port needed (unlike codex PKCE).
- Islands: daemon-run login (`POST /llmux/login/start {"provider":"grok"}`) —
  `LoginProvider` gains `Grok` (aliases `grok|xai|x-ai`, proxy/login.rs:22-47).
  Device flow has no browser callback; the daemon must surface the verification URL to
  the GUI: `GET /llmux/login/status` response gains optional `verification_uri` (the
  `_complete` variant) + `user_code` while pending. The DAEMON best-effort opens the URL
  host-side (parity with the PKCE flows); islands renders the clickable link + user code
  (covers remote daemons without double-tabbing local ones) and keeps polling until
  Done/Error. (Additive fields — older clients ignore them.)

### R3. Stats & usage display (CLI + islands)

- Token/cost stats: the shared Responses SSE core already yields `StreamUsage`; the
  dashboard tracks per-(group, model). Add pricing entry `GROK_4_5 {input 2.0, output
  6.0, cache_read 0.5, cache_creation 0.0}` + `group == "grok"` unknown-model fallback
  (src/pricing.rs builtin table, pricing.rs:58-100).
- Quota windows (**revised 2026-09-17**, post-ship — supersedes the 2026-07-14 "the 7d
  gauge stays empty" revision):
  - **5h burst slot — headers, unchanged.** 200 responses carry
    `x-ratelimit-{limit,remaining}-{requests,tokens}` (RPM/TPM-shaped, no reset). These
    feed the 5h slot via the standard-bucket path with an estimated 60s reset horizon
    (`headers::STANDARD_RESET_FALLBACK`), grok accounts only.
  - **7d slot — the billing endpoint.** `GET {grok upstream}/billing?format=credits`
    (identity headers + evidence in the facts table above) is grok's ACTIVE usage source:
    `src/auth/grok_usage.rs` — `billing_url` (refuses any upstream whose path is not
    `…/v1`; it never falls back to the production chat proxy), `fetch_billing`,
    `parse_billing`. Mapping: `currentPeriod.type` containing `WEEKLY` →
    `seven_day = {utilization: creditUsagePercent/100 clamped, resets_at:
    currentPeriod.end ?? billingPeriodEnd}`; `MONTHLY` (or any other period name) → a
    SCOPED reading labelled "Monthly limit" / the raw enum, so a 30-day allowance can
    never masquerade as the weekly gauge. The snapshot carries no `five_hour`, and
    `PoolState::record_usage` merges `Some` windows only, so the header-fed burst gauge is
    left intact.
  - **Unknown is never zero.** No `currentPeriod`, no period `type` or no usable reset
    instant ⇒ NO window (not 0%). The single exception is upstream's proto3 JSON encoding,
    which omits zero scalars: an ABSENT `creditUsagePercent` next to a PRESENT period
    really is 0%. A present-but-unreadable percent, a non-`config` body, an HTML page or
    the 401 error envelope are `Malformed` — never an empty success, and a failed read
    retains the previous reading. Errors carry fixed sanitized phrases (never the body,
    URL or token).
  - **Both paths feed it.** The periodic poller schedules grok accounts like oauth ones
    (`scheduler::usage::UsagePoller`, `usage_poll_secs` = 300 default, backoff ladder +
    global gap shared; **no billing status ever benches a grok account** — 403/5xx are plain
    poll failures because only 200 and 401 have been observed from that host, so a 403 is an
    unverified shape (WAF/challenge) that would permanently retire a serving account, and
    real revocation is caught on the request path (`classify`, src/proxy/forward.rs:145),
    while a 401 is left to the refresh path), and
    the explicit `POST /llmux/refresh-usage` (with or without `account`) reads billing
    through `usage_controls::read_usage` with `provider: "grok"`. Reset credits stay a
    codex concept: grok's counters remain `None`, and the redemption endpoints keep
    refusing grok accounts.
  - A `free-usage-exhausted` park still shows the existing cooldown/reset countdown UI.
- Surfaces: `llmux status` (client+server), TUI account table + activity log (model +
  effort recorded via grok `effective_request_meta` mirror), `/llmux/status` JSON
  (`group: "grok"`), islands: `UsageProvider.grok` + provider icon (new `grok` asset;
  falls back to text glyph when the asset is missing), closed-island in-flight counts
  (`[claude]{n} [codex]{m} [grok]{k}` — IslandUsageModel.swift:23-27,176-195), usage
  tiles, demo/snapshot fixtures.

### R4. Model switching from Claude Code (gpt-5.6 parity)

- `/model grok-4.5` in Claude Code → Messages body `model: "grok-4.5"` → Classifier
  routes to the Grok group (prefix rule) → scheduler picks a grok account → provider
  passes the **requested slug through verbatim** when it is grok-shaped
  (`grok-` prefix), else rewrites to `shape.model` — the exact
  `resolve_upstream_model` contract codex has on master (codex.rs:~280).
- Effort: Claude Code's effort setting arrives as `output_config.effort` and wins over
  the configured shape effort, clamped to grok's `low|medium|high` (R1). So
  `/model grok-4.5` + effort high ≙ how `gpt-5.6-sol` is used today (live config
  `codex.default_model = "gpt-5.6-sol"`, `~/.config/llmux.json`).
- Live shape control: `POST /llmux/grok {default_model?, reasoning_effort?}` — same
  request/persist contract as `POST /llmux/codex` (server.rs:1089-1140): partial
  update, apply live, persist via `config::update_path`. This is the **daemon HTTP
  API** control (callable directly / by scripts). **Interactive callers are v1-descoped
  and accurately scoped** (consensus round 4):
  - The **TUI `f`/`m`/`e` grok control** (mirroring codex's `perform_remote_codex` at
    tui/mod.rs:1160 + `CodexSettingsDoc`) is NOT in this PR — it needs a parallel
    `GrokSettingsDoc` in the dashboard document and the keybind wiring, a bounded
    follow-up. codex keeps its TUI control; grok's is the endpoint only in v1.
  - The **islands settings row** is likewise descoped (islands has no codex row
    either; `POST /llmux/codex` is TUI/HTTP-only).
  The stated R4 requirement — Claude Code `/model grok-4.5` switching "like gpt-5.6" —
  is delivered by the routing path above (verified in the live receipt), independent
  of these interactive control surfaces.
- Config: new `config.grok` section `{upstream, default_model, reasoning_effort,
  client_model?, trace}` (defaults: cli-chat-proxy URL, `grok-4.7`, null, null, false).

### R5. Refactor: one Responses core, thin codex/grok adapters

- `src/provider/responses.rs` is the shared façade: request validation/conversion lives in
  `src/provider/responses_request.rs`; the façade re-exports it and owns token estimation,
  `RequestPlan`, and response/SSE conversion. `ResponsesFlavor` is `Codex | Grok`, passed
  explicitly alongside `RequestPlan` to the builder, not stored in it. Model and effort
  resolution stay in the thin adapters. `validate_request(body, flavor, count_tokens)` returns
  a `CompatibilityReport` (omitted fields and warnings) or typed `InvalidRequest`; the HTTP
  layer applies strict policy before refresh/network and the builder validates direct calls.
- `codex.rs` shrinks to: `CodexShape`, OAuth/refresh glue, header assembly, flavor
  definition, `effective_request_meta`. `grok.rs` is the same ~small file for grok.
- `forward.rs` binary `is_codex` dispatch (forward.rs:726-770) becomes a three-way
  group match.
- **`on_empty_group` semantics, made precise** (was ambiguous; consensus review): the
  empty-group hook fires ONLY when the matched group has **zero configured accounts**
  (`has_account` = any account whose kind maps to the group, forward.rs:1140 — parked/
  limited accounts still count as configured). `"fallback"` then tries the remaining
  groups in fixed order `Claude → Codex → Grok`, first group with ≥1 configured account
  wins; after fallback the SERVING group's provider applies its own model rewrite (a
  grok-named request served by claude keeps Anthropic semantics — observable, logged).
  A group whose accounts are all parked/limited is NOT empty: the request stays
  in-group and gets the existing all-limited behavior (identical to the claude group
  today). Contract-tested (C2b).
- The original extraction kept Codex behavior bit-identical (existing tests moved only with
  their code). R6 is a subsequent, intentional compatibility change, not that extraction gate.
- **Commit discipline**: the behavior-preserving core extraction lands as its own
  commit (C12 green at that commit), grok lands on top — refactor failures isolate
  from provider failures.

### R6. Explicit Responses compatibility (2026-09-11)

The [shared compatibility spec](../responses-compatibility/spec.md) and
[operational matrix](../operational-reference.md#codex--grok-compatibility-contract) supersede
v1's image-drop and ignored-choice behavior. Anthropic/OpenRouter paths are unchanged.

- Preserve ordered PNG/JPEG base64 user images, including nested `tool_result.content`, as
  data-URI `input_image` items. Multimodal `function_call_output.output` uses an array.
  Require nonempty valid base64, supported MIME, decoded size ≤20 MiB, valid role/tool
  structure; reject URL images (no fetch), other media, unknown blocks and nameless/server
  tools locally with 400/field path. Tool-result errors retain an explicit error-text marker.
- Map `auto`→`auto`, `any`→`required`, `none`→`none`, `tool{name}`→flat named function selector;
  invert boolean `disable_parallel_tool_use`. Validate declared tool names/nonempty tools for
  `any`/`tool`. No tools means omit `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls` together.
- Forward positive-integer `max_tokens` unchanged as `max_output_tokens` but report
  `max_tokens_semantics`. The subscription probe below showed a visible-output cap with
  additional reasoning usage, not proven Anthropic total-budget equivalence or a billing cap.
  Do not clamp the request, fabricate output truncation, or subtract reasoning from reported
  output usage to make the limit appear satisfied.
- Non-null `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k` and nonempty `stop_sequences` return local 400;
  subscription-gateway support is unverified. Empty stop sequences are vacuous; malformed
  stop sequences fail. Top-level `thinking` configuration is distinct from prior-history
  blocks: validate its shape, omit with `thinking_config` in omissions/warnings, strict 400.
  Neither `budget_tokens` nor disabled reasoning is enforced. Counts carry no inference-only
  omission warnings. This closes known controls, not every present or future Messages field.
- Prior assistant `thinking`/`redacted_thinking` are omitted with matching issues; retain other
  transcript content/order. No private-reasoning continuity, encrypted replay, or ciphertext
  cache. Those block types on other roles are invalid. Returned summaries remain output,
  not a replay mechanism; legitimate text/thinking/tool output is not heuristically scrubbed.
- Absent / `X-Llmux-Compatibility: compat` permits only these enumerated losses. Emit relevant
  `X-Llmux-Omitted-Fields` and `X-Llmux-Compatibility-Warnings` plus structured WARN
  provider/fields/request id. `max_tokens_semantics` is a warning, **not** an omitted field.
  Headers are machine-readable diagnostics, not guaranteed UI visibility. `strict` rejects
  any issue with 400 before refresh/network; other policy values also fail.
- Valid text/tool-only counts include serialized schemas/property names in a local chars/4
  heuristic, floor one, with `X-Llmux-Token-Count: estimate`. Image or malformed counts return
  400; counting performs no network/refresh. No image/base64 token estimate is invented.
- `response.incomplete` or a completed envelope with incomplete status and reason
  `max_output_tokens` yields `stop_reason: max_tokens`, partial text and usage. Other reasons
  yield SSE error / aggregate HTTP 502. Truncated arguments must not become executable `{}`.

**Evidence scope.** The official [image guide](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/images/understanding.md),
[Responses reference](https://docs.x.ai/developers/rest-api-reference/inference/responses.md),
and [OpenAPI schema](https://docs.x.ai/openapi.json) were inspected 2026-09-11; the fetched
OpenAPI SHA-256 is `492ae8625849e4f8bffdc576cead51856a41c874a3ccaab59a3aa0b704e1653f`.
These describe `api.x.ai`, not a version-stable contract for `cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`.
Synthetic **2026-09-11 / `grok-4.6`** gateway fixtures accepted user PNG + flat named choice
(`report_color(red)`), required choice, nested tool-result PNG (blue), and none (OK, no calls).
A limit of 16 produced `response.incomplete` / `max_output_tokens`, output usage 302 and
reasoning usage 286. The public reference says the limit includes reasoning; this gateway
fixture instead supports only the narrower visible-output observation. One fixture per case
is not universal model support, JPEG-specific live proof, or proof of prose-free named choice.
Only synthetic outcomes are summarized here; no raw account/user payloads are published.

## Non-goals (v1)

- API-key grok accounts (`api.x.ai` `using_api` path) — subscription OAuth only.
- x_search auto-injection (CLIProxyAPI injects `{"type":"x_search"}` always,
  xai_executor.go:77-78) — llmux does not inject tools the client didn't send.
- Media outside R6's PNG/JPEG base64 subset (URL images, video/audio/documents), websockets
  executor, `/responses/compact`, composer models.
- xAI reasoning replay/ciphertext cache. Resending text/tool history is not private-reasoning
  continuity; R6 explicitly reports prior-thinking omission instead of claiming replay.
- Importing grok-cli's own credential store.
- Active quota polling for grok (no known endpoint).

## Compatibility & rollback (consensus review MUST-FIX)

- `AccountCredential` is an internally-tagged serde enum (`#[serde(tag = "type")]`,
  schema.rs:614-616): an OLD llmux binary **fails to parse** a config containing
  `"type": "grok"` (whole-file parse error, accounts is a plain Vec). This is the same
  contract the `Codex` variant shipped with — precedent, not new risk class — but it is
  now DOCUMENTED: **downgrade procedure** = remove `grok:*` account entries (and
  optionally the additive `grok`/`routing.grok_models` sections, which old binaries
  ignore harmlessly via `#[serde(default)]`) from `~/.config/llmux.json`, then run the
  old binary. `llmux accounts remove <name>` on the NEW binary is the supported path.
- Contract test (C17): a pre-grok config (no grok fields) parses and round-trips
  VALUE-stable under the new binary (the new default `grok` section is serialized;
  old binaries ignore it) — additive-only guarantee, semantic not byte-level.
- Islands↔daemon version skew: additive JSON only; old islands renders grok accounts
  as claude-group (existing `== "codex"` check) during upgrade windows — cosmetic,
  accepted.
- Cost figures for grok (and codex) subscription accounts are **API-list-price
  equivalent estimates**, not billed amounts — documented here; UI copy unchanged in
  v1 (existing cost tiles already carry this meaning for codex).

## Gates (merge-blocking)

1. Behavior-preserving extraction commit: full existing suite green (C12).
2. All contract tests C1–C17 green.
3. **Live wire receipt** before merge: at least one captured real
   `POST …/responses` request + SSE stream against a real grok account through the
   local daemon (raw_io trace on), INCLUDING a ≥2-turn tool-call round trip
   (text/tool transcript-continuity check, **not** private-reasoning replay proof). R6's
   subscription/public differences remain bounded by its separate dated fixtures.
4. External reviewer agent pass (zbrain DEV.md §2).

## Risks / open items

1. **cli-chat-proxy client-version pinning**: header value `0.2.93` may age; kept in one
   const with a comment, config-overridable via `grok.upstream` remaining functional
   even if identity headers change requirements. (CLIProxyAPI pins the same way.)
2. **Subscription/public wire drift**: R6's dated fixtures establish only those observed
   requests. Larger limits, future models, and broader multimodal forms need new evidence;
   public API documentation alone is insufficient. `prompt_cache_key` is deliberately omitted,
   not a field to re-enable merely because one request accepts it.
3. **429 body shape drift**: matching is substring-based on `code`/`error` fields,
   mirroring CLIProxyAPI exactly.
